        - Normal error rate: < 1%

        Determine:
        1. Is there an issue? (Yes/No)
        2. Severity: Critical/Warning/Info
        3. Root cause analysis
        4. Recommended action for user
        5. Should we send alert?
        """

        analysis = await llm.ainvoke(prompt)

        # 3. Send proactive alert if needed
        if analysis['should_alert']:
            await send_alert_to_user({
                "platform": platform,
                "severity": analysis['severity'],
                "message": analysis['message'],
                "action": analysis['recommended_action'],
                "timestamp": datetime.now()
            })
```

**Alert Notification Examples:**

1. **Critical Alert:**
   ```
   üî¥ Twitter API Connection Lost
   Your Twitter account authentication has expired.

   This may affect posting speed but posts will still succeed.
   [View Details] | [Dismiss]
   ```

3. **Info Alert:**
   ```
   üîµ Rate Limit Approaching
   You've used 85% of your Twitter API hourly limit.

   Posts may be delayed for 15 minutes if limit is reached.
   [View Health Dashboard]
   ```

**Expected User Flow:**
1. AI agent monitors platform health every 5 minutes in background
2. Detects anomaly: Twitter API response time 3x slower than normal
3. AI analyzes: "Warning level, temporary slowdown, no action needed"
4. Sends proactive notification to user
5. User sees alert in header bell icon
6. User can view details in Health page or dismiss alert
